  description: "Nonprofit and civic organizations work to deliver critical missions across the country, more vital in the current climate than ever before. The people on the front lines of these missions, don't always have the resources they need to deliver these critical programs. That’s where RfG comes in! We bring together people of varied skills and experiences to build technology solutions that benefit nonprofits. Our core values include: serving nonprofit missions, fostering learning and building community, and creating educational opportunities for technologists regardless of skill level."

  description: "While we don’t charge anything for our services, there are still costs associated with hosting, domain registrations, software/hardware, and all the other things needed to keep the trains running on time. Your support and partnership would enable us to continue building innovative technology solutions, fostering learning for the nascent development community, and bringing together the tech community."
