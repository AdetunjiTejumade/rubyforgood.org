write_up:
  - paragraph: "Linda (she/her) is a maintainer of rubyforgood/casa. She does some stuff:
      Host weekly “office hours” where contributors can drop in to ask questions, pair program, or just say hi.
      Attend weekly stakeholder sync meetings to present our work, ask questions about upcoming works, and stay in touch
      Review and merge PRs (unless one of the other maintainers gets there first!)
      Set up PR templates and issue templates
      Create “technical” github issues about fixing pending tests, making new tests for db seeds, making tests for db migrations, making tests for data loads
      Answer questions on slack
      Reply to questions on github
      Hunts for bugs
      Design and create our CI pipeline
      Setup bugsnag, codeclimate, skylight etc integrations
      Sit in on user training
      Go thru project board “in progress” column and make sure that the issues aren’t already done (they should be auto-closed by PRs but sometimes are not)
      Put sparkly emojis on everything
      She does NOT:
      - try to write all the code!
      - try to get everyone to write the code exactly as she would!
      - review and merge every PR! (CASA has several active maintainers who do a LOT of reviewing and merging!)"
  - paragraph: "Linda started her career at ThoughtWorks in 2011 and in a lot of ways they raised her as a developer. Since then she has worked in assorted industries including but not limited to airlines, payment processing and heathtech. She often deals with devops-ish issues, worries about security, and responds to pages. She likes pair programming and writing tests."
  - paragraph: 'Linda enjoys bicycling distances between zero and forty miles on her Globe7 road bike and is strongly considering an electric bike- recommendations to add to the spreadsheet are very welcome! She also reads a large number of SF&F books. Her degree is no longer offered by the university from which it was obtained, but she usually describes it as "journalism but I got adopted by the CS department".'
