write_up:
  - paragraph: "Zoe Rivka Panagopoulos (she/her/hers) is the Lead Product Manager on the CASA project. Along with her fearless lead developers, Zoe helped build CASA Volunteer Tracking from the ground up in six months and released the first version in September 2020. CASA Volunteer Tracking helps CASA volunteers across the country log their time spent with youth in the foster care system, and serves as a management tool for staff supervisors overseeing volunteer activity. The application is currently being piloted by CASA / Prince George’s County in Maryland. As the Lead PM, Zoe works closely with stakeholders to assess needs and ideate short and long term solutions. She is the point person for all business oriented questions and decisions from open source contributors, and ensures that the platform is positioned for successful multitenancy use down the road. Other responsibilities include: epic and story writing, backlog refinement, quality assurance, release planning, and developing customer facing instructional content."
  - paragraph: "Zoe’s background is in civic tech, and she currently works as a digital consultant in the nonprofit space. She’s worked for large petition platforms such as Change.org, and small, innovative startups such as Brigade (now a part of Countable). Zoe believes that technology has the potential to inspire, empower, and advance society when it serves (and is built by) the people who use it, instead of those who fund, create, and attempt to control it. "
  - paragraph: "As a former CASA volunteer, Zoe remains dedicated to improving the lives of youth in the foster care system across America. One day, she hopes to serve as a foster or adoptive parent herself. In the meantime, she keeps herself busy as a foster parent to senior dogs."
