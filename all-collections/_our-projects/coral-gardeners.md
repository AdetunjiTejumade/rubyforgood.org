mission:
  - paragraph: "Coral Gardeners is an NGO based in Moâ€™orea, French Polynesia, with a mission to save coral reefs through coral gardening. Their work involves two primary activities related to that mission:"
  - list:
    - li: "They educate adults and children about coral reefs, why they are important and the threats that the reefs face."
    - li: "They use the process of coral gardening to restore reefs by planting healthy coral fragments back onto the reef, primarily on the reef near Mo'orea, which has been heavily impacted."
built_by_rfg:
  - paragraph: "Tracking restoration activities is a manual process involving the use of an underwater writing board, which then has to be transferred to a log booking system. This process is lengthy and labor intensive, and requires staff to perform calculations to determine the current status of their coral tables. It is also relatively opaque, making historical information and trends very difficult to access and assess."
