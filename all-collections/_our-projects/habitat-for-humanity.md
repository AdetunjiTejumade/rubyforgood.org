mission:
  - paragraph: "Despite hurricane Katrina happening about a decade ago, there are still a lot of displaced people in temporary residences who need somewhere to call home. The amazing people at Habitat for Humanity are trying to fix this with their work in New Orleans 9th ward (one of the hardest hit areas by Katrina) and with a recent grant they received their work is only going to move quicker. The problem is, one of the requirements of the grant is a stricter recording and reporting process of their 300 or so daily volunteers which is where we come in! Let's help them with the great work they are doing by making this process faster so they have more time for rebuilding people's lives."

  - paragraph: "Volunteers will use this app to sign in and out of work sites by entering a touch-based signature on their smartphone. The technical details will be decided by the team as a group, but this JS widget for taking signatures is promising (try it on your phone): https://github.com/szimek/signature_pad"
